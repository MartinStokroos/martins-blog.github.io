## Design for 3D-printed parts
Modification Attempt | openSCAD files | Remarks
-------------------- | -------------- | -------
 #1 | G50FFL_spacer_v1.scad G20SC_spacer_v1.scad | Mid driver sticks out above the baffle causing(?) a worse dip in the frequency reponse around 1.8kHz. The tweeter spacer does not need extra fixation holes to be drilled in the brackets. M4 hex-nuts can be pressed into the holes intended for mounting the tweeter on top of the spacer ring.  (3D-print with support on). The dust covers can not be put back, because the driver domes are sticking too far outside. 
 #2 | G50FFL_baffle_v1.scad G20SC_spacer_v2.scad | Attempt two with a new baffle/horn design for the G50FFL. (3D-print with support on). The dome is placed inwards to the original position of the AD0211 dome. The metal flange of the G50FFL must be removed by removing the four screws from the front side. The extra gasket, included with the G50FFL package, must be used between the driver and the new baffle/horn. The tweeter has been replaced by the G20SC and has been placed deeper inwards too. It is mounted with a 2mm spacer ring, leaving enough room for extreme woofer excursions. Fixation holes must be drilled in the brackets for mounting. The dust covers can be put back on. A small dip in the frequency response has been observed around the mid/high crossover frequency (~5kHz).
 #3 | G50FFL_baffle_v1.scad | The squawker AD0211 has been replaced by the G50FFL with the new baffle/horn design as in attempt #2. The original AD0136 tweeter has been restored.  The midrange frequencies around 1kHz are elevated a few dB's compared to the original. A minor modification in the electronics solves this problem.
Bonus | 544_capstand.scad | Capacitor mount, see pictures below.
